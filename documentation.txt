DESCRIPTION:
<script src="https://unpkg.com/typed.js@2.0.132/dist/typed.umd.js"></script>:

This line includes the Typed.js library into your HTML document. It is hosted on the Unpkg CDN (Content Delivery Network), and the version specified is 2.0.132.
<script>:

This is the opening tag for a JavaScript script block.
var typingEffect = new Typed(".multiText", { ... });:

Declares a variable named typingEffect and assigns it the result of creating a new instance of the Typed class. This instance is associated with the HTML element having the class "multiText."
strings: ["coder", "Developer"],:

An array of strings that will be used for the typing effect. The words "coder" and "Developer" are the strings that will be displayed in the specified HTML element.
loop: true,:

Sets the loop property to true, allowing the typing effect to loop indefinitely.
typeSpeed: 100,:

Specifies the typing speed in milliseconds per character. In this case, characters will be typed with a speed of 100 milliseconds.
backSpeed: 80,:

Specifies the backspacing speed in milliseconds per character. Characters will be erased at a speed of 80 milliseconds.
backDelay: 1500:

Sets a delay in milliseconds after the typing is complete before starting the backspacing. In this case, there is a delay of 1500 milliseconds (1.5 seconds) before the text starts to backspace.
The Typed.js library is a popular JavaScript library for creating typing animations on web pages. This code initializes a typing effect on an HTML element with the class "multiText" using the specified settings.
